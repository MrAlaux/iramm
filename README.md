# Nugget Doom

Nugget Doom (formerly known as IRamm) is a fork of [Crispy Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Crispy_Doom), essentially intended as a personal playground to mess around with Doom's source code.

### Features (with default bindings if applicable)

 * Crouch/duck (<kbd>C</kbd>)
 * A setting to adjust the player's POV's height closer to the Doom marine's helmet
 * A setting to disable the crisp background in the Crispness menu

### Building

As a Crispy Doom fork, itself a Chocolate Doom fork, their build instructions should also apply here: [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Building-on-Windows); [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Building_Chocolate_Doom_on_Windows).
